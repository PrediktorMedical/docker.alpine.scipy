# alpine docker with numerical python
The following docker is meant to be a minimal image to run numerical
python applications. It's based on alpine and has python installed 
with numpy and pandas. The image will be flattened and it's total 
compressed size ~58MB. This might not seem too small, however, a
similar ubuntu/debian will land on several hundred of MBs.
